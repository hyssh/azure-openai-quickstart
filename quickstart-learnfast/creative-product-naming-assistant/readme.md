# Creative Product Naming Assistant

## Goal  

The goal of this project is to provide a quickstart guide for citizen developers who want to build web apps using Azure OpenAI and Streamlit. This guide will cover the basics of setting up and running the services, as well as some tips and tricks for making your app more user-friendly.
  
## How it Works  

Azure OpenAI is a cloud-based AI platform that provides natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. In this project, it is used to generate creative product names based on user inputs. The model is trained on a dataset of existing product names, and uses machine learning algorithms to generate new, unique names.

Streamlit is a Python library that allows developers to create interactive web apps with minimal coding. In this project, it is used to create a user interface where users can input keywords and receive generated product names. Streamlit also allows for easy integration with Azure OpenAI, making it a great choice for building AI-powered web apps.
