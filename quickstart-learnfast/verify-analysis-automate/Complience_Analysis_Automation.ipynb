For example, use a system that can handle the volume, velocity, and variety of the audit logs, and provide the functionality, performance, and usability of the audit analysis.  "

       "The main update in the Access control policy is to extend control to views and stored procedures. \n",
       "\n",
       "### How to apply\n",
       "To comply with the new policy, controlled access should be implemented on views and stored procedures. This can be done through the database management system or database service that is being used. Access control should be updated to include these levels and appropriately managed and monitored.\n",

       "### How to apply\n",
