Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined its use \\r\\nto be contra -indicated, or for experimental or investigative  drugs not otherwise approved for any indication b y the \\r\\nFDA.  \\r\\nPrescription Drug Formulary  \\r\\nThis benefit uses a specific list of covered prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as a formulary.  Our \\r\\nPharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, which includes medical practitioners and pharmacists from the \\r\\ncommunity , frequently reviews current medical studies and pharmaceutical information . The Committee then \\r\\nmakes recommendations on which drugs are included on our drug lists . The drug lists are updated quarterly \\r\\nbased on the Committee 's recommendations .  \\r\\nThe formula ry includes both generic and brand name drugs . Consult the Pharmacy Benefit Guide or RX Search \\r\\ntool listed on our web page, or contact Customer Service for a complete list of your plan 's covered prescription \\r\\ndrugs.  \\r\\nDrugs not included in the formulary are n ot covered by this plan.  \\r\\nExceptions Request for Non -Formulary Drugs  \\r\\nYou or your provider may request that you get a non -formulary drug or a dose that is not on the drug list either in \\r\\nwriting, electronically, or by telephone . Under some circumstances, such  as the ones listed below, a non -\\r\\nformulary drug may be covered if one of the following is true:  \\r\\n There is no formulary drug or alternative available  \\r\\n You cannot tolerate the formulary drug  \\r\\n The formulary drug or dose is not safe or effective for your conditio n \\r\\nYour provider must give us a written or oral statement providing a justification in support of the need for the non -\\r\\nformulary drug to treat your condition, including a statement that all covered formulary drugs on any tier will be (or \\r\\nhave been) ineffect ive, and would not be as effective as the non -formulary drug, or would have adverse side \\r\\neffects . We will review your request and let you or your provider know within 72 hours in writing if it is approved .

Exigent circumstances include when you are suffering from a health condition that may \\r\\nseriously jeopardize your life, health or abilit y to regain maximum body function or when you are undergoing a \\r\\ncurrent course of treatment using a non -formulary drug . In addition to your provider 's justification for the non -\\r\\nformulary drug as described above, your provider will need to give us an oral or  written statement that confirms \\r\\nthat an exigency exists, including the basis for the exigency --the harm that could reasonably come to you if the \\r\\nrequested non -formulary drug was not provided within the timeframes of the standard exceptions request .

If the IRO grants your request for an exception, your cost will be as shown on the Summary of Y our \\r\\nCosts  for formulary generic and brand name drugs .

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined its use \\r\\nto be contra -indicated, or for experimental or investigative  drugs not otherwise approved for any indication b y the \\r\\nFDA.  \\r\\nPrescription Drug Formulary  \\r\\nThis benefit uses a specific list of covered prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as a formulary.  Our \\r\\nPharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, which includes medical practitioners and pharmacists from the \\r\\ncommunity , frequently reviews current medical studies and pharmaceutical information . The Committee then \\r\\nmakes recommendations on which drugs are included on our drug lists . The drug lists are updated quarterly \\r\\nbased on the Committee 's recommendations .  \\r\\nThe formula ry includes both generic and brand name drugs .

Under some circumstances, such  as the ones listed below, a non -\\r\\nformulary drug may be covered if one of the following is true:  \\r\\n There is no formulary drug or alternative available  \\r\\n You cannot tolerate the formulary drug  \\r\\n The formulary drug or dose is not safe or effective for your conditio n \\r\\nYour provider must give us a written or oral statement providing a justification in support of the need for the non -\\r\\nformulary drug to treat your condition, including a statement that all covered formulary drugs on any tier will be (or \\r\\nhave been) ineffect ive, and would not be as effective as the non -formulary drug, or would have adverse side \\r\\neffects . We will review your request and let you or your provider know within 72 hours in writing if it is approved . If \\r\\napproved, your cost will be as shown on the Summary of Your Costs  for formulary generic and brand name \\r\\ndrugs and will be covered for the duration of the prescription . If your request is not approved, the drug will not be \\r\\ncovered.  \\r\\nExpedited Exceptions Request for Non -Formulary Drugs  \\r\\nIf exigent circum stances exist, you or your provider may request that you get a non -formulary drug or a dose that \\r\\nis not on the drug list . Exigent circumstances include when you are suffering from a health condition that may \\r\\nseriously jeopardize your life, health or abilit y to regain maximum body function or when you are undergoing a \\r\\ncurrent course of treatment using a non -formulary drug . In addition to your provider 's justification for the non -\\r\\nformulary drug as described above, your provider will need to give us an oral or  written statement that confirms \\r\\nthat an exigency exists, including the basis for the exigency --the harm that could reasonably come to you if the \\r\\nrequested non -formulary drug was not provided within the timeframes of the standard exceptions request .

If the IRO grants your request for an exception, your cost will be as shown on the Summary of Y our \\r\\nCosts  for formulary generic and brand name drugs .
